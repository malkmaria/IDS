## Motivation and goal

Lung cancer is a major global health problem, with survival rates dependent on a variety of factors, including the course of treatment.  
The goal of this research project is to use synthetic medical data to predict survival rates after the first lung cancer diagnosis.  
By analyzing synthetic patient treatment trajectories, we aim to identify key procedures, drugs and other various treatment options, that influence survival and develop a predictive model to help make more informed decisions about patient care.

## Guide
project_workflow.ipynb - Contains the complete workflow of our project. Workflow consists of:
*loading in the raw data and processing it  
*doing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify key features using processed data, with different feature selection combinations
*train models on processed data and generated PCs, using parameters  doing Grid Search
